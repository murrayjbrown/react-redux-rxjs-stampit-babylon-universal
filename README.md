# react-redux-rxjs-stampit-babylon-universal

This demonstrates an isomorphic (universal) reactive web application, built using Nathan Vale's [react-redux-rxjs-universal-starter-kit](https://github.com/nathanvale/react-redux-rxjs-universal-starter-kit), which includes [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux),[Redux-Observable](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable), [ReactiveX v5 (rxjs)](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/rxjs), and support for hot module loading.

A sample game component is based on the [BabylonJS](https://babylonjs.com) game engine with a scene driver constructed using composable *'stamps'* via the [Stampit (v2)](https://github.com/stampit-org/stampit) library.
